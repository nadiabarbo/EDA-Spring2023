## Simple regression
Our first research question is: Does mean lake temperature recorded during July change with depth across all lakes?

3. State the null and alternative hypotheses for this question:

> Answer:
H0: mu_1 = mu_2 = mu_n (The mean lake temperature during July does not change with depth across all lakes)
Ha: mu_1 != mu_2 != mu_n (The mean lake temperature during July does change with depth across all lakes)


4.  Wrangle your NTL-LTER dataset with a pipe function so that the records meet the following criteria: 
 * Only dates in July. 
 * Only the columns: `lakename`, `year4`, `daynum`, `depth`, `temperature_C`
 * Only complete cases (i.e., remove NAs)

5. Visualize the relationship among the two continuous variables with a scatter plot of temperature by depth. Add a smoothed line showing the linear model, and limit temperature values from 0 to 35 Â°C. Make this plot look pretty and easy to read.

```{r scatterplot, fig.height = 6, fig.width = 10}
#4
Lake_Nutrients_processed <-  Lake_Nutrients %>% #creating processed data frame
  filter(month(sampledate) == "7") %>% #filtering for only samples in July
  select(lakename, year4, daynum, depth, temperature_C) %>% #selecting only the columns we want
  drop_na() #dropping NAs

#5
ggplot(Lake_Nutrients_processed, aes(x=depth, y=temperature_C)) + #setting variables to plot
  geom_point(color='palegreen3') + #make scatterplot with green points
  geom_smooth(method="lm", color='black', se=FALSE) + #adding best fit line
  ylim(0,35) + #limiting temperature values to 0-35
  labs(x="Depth (m)", #adding x label
       y="Temperature (C)", #adding y label
       title="Temperature by Depth Changes in July Months") #adding title
```


6. Interpret the figure. What does it suggest with regards to the response of temperature to depth? Do the distribution of points suggest about anything about the linearity of this trend?

> Answer: The figure suggests that as the depth increases, the temperature decreases. This does not look like a linear relatioship - it looks more like an exponential decrease in temperature as depth increases.


7. Perform a linear regression to test the relationship and display the results

```{r linear.regression}
#7
Temperature.regression <- lm(Lake_Nutrients_processed$temperature_C ~ Lake_Nutrients_processed$depth) #performing linear regression
summary(Temperature.regression) #show summary of linear regression

```


8. Interpret your model results in words. Include how much of the variability in temperature is explained by changes in depth, the degrees of freedom on which this finding is based, and the statistical significance of the result. Also mention how much temperature is predicted to change for every 1m change in depth. 

> Answer: The relationship between decreasing temperatures and increasing depths was found to be statistically significant (p value < 2e-16). About 73.87% of the variability in temperature is explained by changes in depth (given by the R-squared value). These findings are based on 9726 degrees of freedom. According to the linear regression, temperature is predicted to decrease by 1.95 degrees Celcius for every 1m change in depth.

## Multiple regression
Let's tackle a similar question from a different approach. Here, we want to explore what might the best set of predictors for lake temperature in July across the monitoring period at the North Temperate Lakes LTER. 


9. Run an AIC to determine what set of explanatory variables (year4, daynum, depth) is best suited to predict temperature.

10. Run a multiple regression on the recommended set of variables. 

```{r temperature.model}
#9
Temperature_AIC <- lm(data = Lake_Nutrients_processed, temperature_C ~ year4 + daynum + 
              depth) #running linear multiple regression using 3 designated explanatory variables 
step(Temperature_AIC) #using step function to determine which variables are best suited to predict temperature

#10
Temperature_model <- lm(data = Lake_Nutrients_processed, temperature_C ~ year4 + daynum + 
              depth) #the step function kept all four variables
summary(Temperature_model) #summary of best fit model

```

11. What is the final set of explanatory variables that the AIC method suggests we use to predict temperature in our multiple regression? How much of the observed variance does this model explain? Is this an improvement over the model using only depth as the explanatory variable?

> Answer: The step function/AIC method suggested we keep all three explanatory variables in the multiple regression model to predict temperature: year4, daynum, and depth. This multiple regression model explains 74.11% of the variance, which is slightly more than the linear regression model using only depth as an explanatory variable (73.87%). 



---
## Analysis of Variance

12. Now we want to see whether the different lakes have, on average, different temperatures in the month of July. Run an ANOVA test to complete this analysis. (No need to test assumptions of normality or similar variances.) Create two sets of models: one expressed as an ANOVA models and another expressed as a linear model (as done in our lessons).

```{r anova.model}
#12
Temp_Lake.anova <- aov(data = Lake_Nutrients_processed, temperature_C ~ lakename) #running ANOVA model
summary(Temp_Lake.anova) #showing summary of anova model

Temp_Lake.anova2 <- lm(data = Lake_Nutrients_processed, temperature_C ~ lakename) #running linear regression model
summary(Temp_Lake.anova2) #showing summary of linear regression model
```

13. Is there a significant difference in mean temperature among the lakes? Report your findings. 

> Answer: There is a significant different in mean temperature among the lakes, with a p value < 2e-16. When looking at the significance of individual lakes on temperature, all lakes were highly significant (p values labeled as either *** or **). According to the linear model, 4.87% of temperature variance can be explained by the lakename variable. The linear model also suggests that the following lakes decrease temperature by the corresponding amount for every 1m change in depth: Crampton Lake - decrease of 2.31 degrees, East Long Lake - decrease of 7.40 degrees, Hummingbird Lake - decrease of 6.89 degrees, Paul Lake - decrease of 3.85 degrees, Peter Lake - decrease of 4.35 degrees, Tuesday Lake - decrease of 6.60 degrees, Ward Lake - decrease of 3.21 degrees, and West Long Lake - decrease of 6.09 degrees. 


14. Create a graph that depicts temperature by depth, with a separate color for each lake. Add a geom_smooth (method = "lm", se = FALSE) for each lake. Make your points 50 % transparent. Adjust your y axis limits to go from 0 to 35 degrees. Clean up your graph to make it pretty. 

```{r scatterplot.2, fig.height = 6, fig.width = 10}
#14.
ggplot(Lake_Nutrients_processed, aes(x=depth, y=temperature_C, color=lakename)) + #setting variables to plot (colored by lakename)
  geom_point() + #making scatterplot
  scale_color_npg() + #setting color of points
  geom_smooth(method="lm", color='black', se=FALSE) + #adding line of best fit
  ylim(0,35) + #setting y axis limits
  labs(x="Depth (m)", #naming x axis
       y="Temperature (C)", #naming y axis
       title="Depth and Temperature Changes in July Months per Lake", #adding title
       color="Lake Name") #changing legend title

```

15. Use the Tukey's HSD test to determine which lakes have different means.

```{r tukey.test}
#15
TukeyHSD(Temp_Lake.anova) #running Tukey HSD test

Temps.groups <- HSD.test(Temp_Lake.anova, "lakename", group = TRUE) #finding groupings from Tukey HSD test
Temps.groups #showing those groupings
```

16.From the findings above, which lakes have the same mean temperature, statistically speaking, as Peter Lake? Does any lake have a mean temperature that is statistically distinct from all the other lakes?

>Answer: Paul Lake and Ward Lake have statistically the same mean temperature as Peter Lake. There are no lakes that have a mean temperature that is statistically distict from all other lakes. 

 

17. If we were just looking at Peter Lake and Paul Lake. What's another test we might explore to see whether they have distinct mean temperatures? 

>Answer: If we were just looking at Peter Lake and Paul Lake, we could also run a two sample t-test to determine if the two lakes have distinct mean temperatures. A two sample t-test uses a continuous response variable (temperature) and one categorical explanatory variable with two categories (lakename - in this case the two categories are Peter Lake and Paul Lake). This two sample t-test will test the mean response variable of the two categories and determine if they are statistically the same or different.



18. Wrangle the July data to include only records for Crampton Lake and Ward Lake. Run the two-sample T-test on these data to determine whether their July temperature are same or different. What does the test say? Are the mean temperatures for the lakes equal? Does that match you answer for part 16?

```{r t.test}
#wranging data
Lake_Nutrients_July_CramptonWard <- Lake_Nutrients_processed %>% #creating processed data frame
  filter(lakename %in% c("Crampton Lake", "Ward Lake")) #filtering for only samples from Crampton Lake and Ward Lake

Temp.twosample <- t.test(Lake_Nutrients_July_CramptonWard$temperature_C ~ Lake_Nutrients_July_CramptonWard$lakename) #running two-sample t-test
Temp.twosample #showing results of t-test
```

>Answer: The t-test tells us that we cannot reject the null hypothesis that the mean temperatures of Crampton Lake and Ward Lake are the same. In other words, the mean temperatures within these two lakes are not statistically different from one another (they are statistically equal). We cannot reject the null hypothesis because the p-value from the t-test is 0.2649. This does match the answer for part 16 because Crampton Lake and Ward Lake were both sorted into group b, meaning that their mean temperatures were statistically the same as one another. You can also confirm this because the estimated mean temperatures of the two lakes (given by the t-test) are within the same within the 95% confidence interval.
